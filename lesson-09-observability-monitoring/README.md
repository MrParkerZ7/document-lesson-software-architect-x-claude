# Lesson 09: Observability and Monitoring

## Overview

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its external outputs. For Software Architects, implementing proper observability is crucial for maintaining reliable, performant systems and quickly diagnosing issues in production.

## Key Concepts

### Three Pillars of Observability
- **Logs**: Discrete events with timestamps providing detailed information about system occurrences
- **Metrics**: Numeric measurements aggregated over time for monitoring and alerting
- **Traces**: End-to-end request flows showing causality and latency distribution

### Logging Best Practices
- Use structured logging (JSON format)
- Include correlation IDs for request tracking
- Implement centralized log aggregation
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)

### Metric Types
- **Counter**: Cumulative values that only increase
- **Gauge**: Point-in-time values that can go up or down
- **Histogram**: Distribution of values
- **Summary**: Pre-calculated quantiles

### Distributed Tracing Concepts
- **Trace**: End-to-end journey of a request
- **Span**: Single unit of work within a trace
- **Context Propagation**: Passing trace metadata between services
- **Sampling**: Strategies for managing trace volume

### Alerting Principles
- Alert on symptoms, not causes
- Include context and runbook links
- Avoid alert fatigue through proper tuning
- Implement proper escalation policies

## Summary

Observability is essential for operating reliable distributed systems. By combining logs, metrics, and traces, teams gain comprehensive visibility into system behavior. Effective alerting transforms observability data into actionable insights, enabling rapid incident response. Modern observability architectures integrate these pillars into unified platforms for efficient troubleshooting and proactive monitoring.
