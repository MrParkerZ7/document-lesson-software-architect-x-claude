## Overview

The three pillars of observability - logs, metrics, and traces - form the foundation of understanding system behavior. Together, they provide complementary views into what is happening within distributed systems, enabling teams to detect, diagnose, and resolve issues effectively.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the three pillars: logs, metrics, and traces
- Learn how each pillar contributes to system observability
- Recognize when to use each type of telemetry data
- Understand how the pillars complement each other

## Key Concepts

### Logs
- Discrete events with timestamps and context
- Provide detailed information about specific occurrences
- Essential for debugging and audit trails

### Metrics
- Numeric measurements aggregated over time
- Enable alerting and trend analysis
- Efficient storage and querying

### Traces
- End-to-end request flows across services
- Show causality and latency distribution
- Critical for distributed system debugging
