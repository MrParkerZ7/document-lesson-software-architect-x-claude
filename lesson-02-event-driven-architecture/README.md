# ⚡ Lesson 02: Event-Driven Architecture

## 📋 Overview

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software design paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events—significant changes in state or occurrences. This architecture style enables loosely coupled, scalable, and responsive systems.

## 🎓 Summary

Event-Driven Architecture enables building scalable, loosely coupled systems that can react to changes in real-time. Understanding message brokers, event patterns like Event Sourcing and CQRS, and stream processing technologies is essential for modern distributed systems.

> 💡 **Key Insight**: The key is choosing the right patterns and tools based on your specific requirements for consistency, latency, and complexity.
