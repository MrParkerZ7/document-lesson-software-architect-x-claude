## Overview

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently. This section covers the fundamental concepts, lifecycle, and metrics that define DevOps culture and practices.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the DevOps lifecycle and continuous improvement loop
- Learn core DevOps principles and practices
- Master DORA metrics for measuring DevOps performance

---

## 1.1 DevOps Lifecycle

The DevOps lifecycle represents a continuous loop of planning, building, testing, deploying, and monitoring software.

## 1.2 DevOps Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Automation** | Automate repetitive tasks |
| **Continuous Integration** | Merge code frequently, test automatically |
| **Continuous Delivery** | Always keep code deployable |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Manage infrastructure through code |
| **Monitoring and Logging** | Observe system behavior |
| **Communication** | Break down silos between teams |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Learn from failures, iterate |

---

## 1.3 DevOps Metrics (DORA)

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics are the industry standard for measuring DevOps performance.

| Metric | Description | Elite Performance |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Deployment Frequency** | How often you deploy | Multiple times/day |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Code commit to production | Less than 1 hour |
| **Change Failure Rate** | Percentage of deployments causing failure | 0-15% |
| **Time to Restore** | Time to recover from failure | Less than 1 hour |

## Key Takeaways

1. DevOps is a culture shift, not just tools
2. Automation is foundational to DevOps success
3. DORA metrics provide objective measurement of DevOps maturity
4. Continuous improvement through feedback loops is essential
