# Lesson 01: Software Design & Architecture

## Overview

Software Design & Architecture is the foundation of building scalable, maintainable, and robust systems. As a Software Architect, mastering design patterns, architecture styles, and principles is essential for making informed decisions that impact the entire software lifecycle.

## Summary

Software Design & Architecture forms the backbone of any successful software system. Understanding patterns, principles, and styles enables architects to make informed decisions that balance immediate needs with long-term maintainability. The key is choosing the right approach for the specific context rather than applying one-size-fits-all solutions.
