## 3.1 SOLID Principles

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **S**ingle Responsibility | A class should have one reason to change | Separate validation from persistence |
| **O**pen/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification | Use interfaces for extensibility |
| **L**iskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable for base types | Proper inheritance hierarchies |
| **I**nterface Segregation | Many specific interfaces over one general | Split large interfaces |
| **D**ependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions | Use dependency injection |

## 3.2 Other Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) | Avoid code duplication |
| **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) | Simplicity over complexity |
| **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) | Don't build features until needed |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Divide program into distinct sections |
| **Composition over Inheritance** | Prefer object composition |
| **Fail Fast** | Detect and report errors immediately |
| **Convention over Configuration** | Sensible defaults reduce configuration |
