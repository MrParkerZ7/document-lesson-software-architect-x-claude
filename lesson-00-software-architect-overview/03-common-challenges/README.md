## 3.1 Challenges Architects Face

| Challenge | Description | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Ivory Tower Syndrome** | Being disconnected from implementation | Stay hands-on, attend team meetings, code occasionally |
| **Decision Paralysis** | Over-analyzing without deciding | Set decision deadlines, accept "good enough" |
| **Scope Creep** | Taking on too much responsibility | Define clear boundaries, delegate appropriately |
| **Outdated Knowledge** | Skills becoming stale | Continuous learning, hands-on experimentation |
| **Communication Gap** | Misalignment with stakeholders | Regular sync meetings, visual communication |
| **Political Challenges** | Navigating organizational politics | Build relationships, focus on outcomes |
| **Technical Debt** | Inherited or accumulating debt | Document debt, plan remediation, prioritize |

## 3.2 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Better Approach |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Architecture Astronaut** | Over-engineering, premature abstraction | Start simple, evolve as needed |
| **Rubber Stamp Architect** | Approving everything without review | Engage meaningfully in decisions |
| **PowerPoint Architect** | Only creating presentations, no real work | Produce actionable artifacts |
| **One-Size-Fits-All** | Applying same solution everywhere | Context-appropriate decisions |
| **Big Bang Architecture** | Complete upfront design | Evolutionary architecture |
| **Technology Hype Chaser** | Adopting every new technology | Pragmatic technology selection |
