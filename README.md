# Software Architect Role Guide

## What is a Software Architect?

A **Software Architect** is a senior technical role responsible for making high-level design decisions and establishing technical standards for software systems. They bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation, ensuring that software solutions are scalable, maintainable, secure, and aligned with organizational goals.

Software Architects serve as the technical visionaries who define the blueprint of systems before development begins and guide teams throughout the implementation process.
