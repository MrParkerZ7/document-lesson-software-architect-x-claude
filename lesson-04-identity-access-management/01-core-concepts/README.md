## Overview

This section introduces the fundamental concepts of Identity and Access Management (IAM), establishing the foundation for understanding authentication, authorization, and identity terminology.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ)
- Learn key identity terminology and concepts
- Recognize the role of identity in security architecture

## Key Concepts

### Authentication vs Authorization

**Authentication (AuthN)** answers "Who are you?" - verifying identity through passwords, MFA, biometrics, or tokens.

**Authorization (AuthZ)** answers "What can you do?" - determining access rights and permissions.

### Identity Terminology

- **Identity**: Unique representation of a user, service, or device
- **Principal**: An entity that can be authenticated
- **Credential**: Information used to verify identity
- **Claim**: A statement about an entity
- **Token**: Portable representation of identity and claims
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Service that manages identities
