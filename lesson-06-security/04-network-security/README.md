## Overview

Network Security encompasses policies, practices, and technologies to protect network integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility. This covers defense in depth, WAF, and network segmentation.

## Key Concepts

### Defense in Depth Layers

| Layer | Components |
|-------|------------|
| Perimeter | Firewalls, WAF, DDoS protection |
| Network | Segmentation, VPNs, IDS/IPS |
| Host | OS hardening, endpoint protection |
| Application | Input validation, authentication |
| Data | Encryption, access controls |

### Zero Trust Principles

1. Verify Explicitly
2. Least Privilege Access
3. Assume Breach
